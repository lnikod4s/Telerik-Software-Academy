## Database Performance for Developers
### _Homework_

1. Create a table in SQL Server with 10 000 000 log entries (date + text).
	* Search in the table by date range. Check the speed (without caching).
1. Add an index to speed-up the search by date.
	* Test the search speed (after cleaning the cache).
1. Add a full text index for the text column.
	* Try to search with and without the full-text index and compare the speed.
1. Create the same table in MySQL and partition it by date (1990, 2000, 2010).
	* Fill 1 000 000 log entries.
	* Compare the searching speed in all partitions (random dates) to certain partition (e.g. year 1995).
