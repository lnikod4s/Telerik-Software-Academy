# Teamwork
## Scrum Simulation - How to organize a party
### First:
* Determine the Team
* Choose a Product Owner
* Choose a Scrum Master

### Second:
The **Product Owner** should:
* Determine what kind of a party it is
* Who is it for
* What’s its purpose
* Define the theme, the main tasks, and of course - the deadline
* Break down the requirements into stories
* Set priority of each story in the main Product Backlog
* Answer any question related to the requirements

The **Team** should organize a planning meeting where to:
* Calculate its capacity
* Evaluate the stories at high level by using planning poker or relative evaluation
* Commit for a given number of  stories that will complete within the iteration, based on the preliminary given estimate
* Break down the stories into tasks
* Estimate the tasks and assign owner of each task

The **Team** should setup re-occurring Daily Standup meeting where to answer at each of the following three questions:
* What did you do yesterday?
* What will you do today?
* Are there any impediments in your way?

The **Scrum Master** should support the team in process adopting by:
* Resolve as quickly as possible any impediments that the Team might have
* Be sure that the process is strictly followed by all roles in the Scrum (i.e. the Product Backlog is
prepared by the PO, the Team had planning meeting and committed for a given piece of work, the Team has daily standup meeting and all team members are at time and etc.)
* Keep the process vision straight

### Third:
**Results:**
* Use the created area “Organize Party” in your team project in TeamPulse
* Present the completed work to the stakeholders (demo to the trainers a.k.a “Scrum Review meeting”)

**Tips:**
* The Scrum Master should communicate with the Product Owner if additional questions or situations arise.
* The Product Owner should prioritize the stories but the team should decide how to combine them inside Sprints
* Every team-member should have tasks assigned
