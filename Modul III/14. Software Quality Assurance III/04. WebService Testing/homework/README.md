# Web Service testing
## Homework
Below there are a couple of web services:
* Service that gives weather forecast [http://www.webservicex.net/globalweather.asmx?WSDL](http://www.webservicex.net/globalweather.asmx?WSDL)
	* Create valid and invalid requests.
	* Prepare tests and group them in a suite.
	* If you find bugs, report them.

* Service that gives country details [http://www.webservicex.net/country.asmx?WSDL](http://www.webservicex.net/country.asmx?WSDL) 
	* Create valid and invalid requests.
	* Prepare tests and group them in a suite.
	* Add appropriate assertions.
	* Use at least two property transfers (e.g. take countryâ€™s currency and then use it in GetCountryByCurrency)
	* If you find bugs, report them.

 
Result:
As a result of the homework you have to submit two Soap UI projects and if you have found bugs describe them in Excel or Word document.

Make sure you give your tests, test suites and bug reports meaningful names or descriptions.
