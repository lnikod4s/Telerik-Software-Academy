## Arrays

1. Write a script that allocates array of 20 integers and initializes each element by its index multiplied by 5. Print the obtained array on the console.
2. Write a script that compares two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).
3. Write a script that finds the maximal sequence of equal elements in an array.

    **Example:** [2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1] -> [2, 2, 2].

4. Write a script that finds the maximal increasing sequence in an array.

    **Example:** [3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4] -> [2, 3, 4].

5. Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order. Write a script to sort an array. Use the **"selection sort"** algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc. Hint: Use a second array
6. Write a program that finds the most frequent number in an array.

    **Example:** {4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 4, 9, 3} -> 4 (5 times)

7. \* Write a program that finds the index of given element in a sorted array of integers by using the binary search algorithm.
