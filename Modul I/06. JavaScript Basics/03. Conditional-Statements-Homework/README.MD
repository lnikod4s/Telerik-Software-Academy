1. Write an `if` statement that examines two integer variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one.
* Write a program that shows the sign (+ or -) of the product of three real numbers without calculating it. Use a sequence of `if` statements.
* Write a program that finds the biggest of three integers using nested `if` statements.
* Sort 3 real values in descending order using nested `if` statements.
* Write a program that asks for a digit and depending on the input shows the name of that digit (in English) using a `switch` statement.
* Write a program that enters the coefficients `a, b and c` of a quadratic equation *ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0* and calculates and prints its real roots. Note that quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots.
* Write a program that finds the greatest of given 5 variables.
* Write a program that converts a number in the range [0...999] to a text corresponding to its English pronunciation. Examples:
