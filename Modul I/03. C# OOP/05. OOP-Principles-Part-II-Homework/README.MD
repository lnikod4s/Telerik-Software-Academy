Homework: OOP Principles - Part 2
=================================

### Problem 1. Shapes
*	Define abstract class `Shape` with only one `abstract` method `CalculateSurface()` and fields `width` and `height`.
*	Define two new classes `Triangle` and `Rectangle` that implement the `virtual` method and return the surface of the figure (height*width for rectangle and height*width/2 for triangle).
*	Define class `Circle` and suitable constructor so that at initialization `height` must be kept equal to `width` and implement the `CalculateSurface()` method.
*	Write a program that tests the behaviour of the `CalculateSurface()` method for different shapes (`Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`) stored in an array.

### Problem 2. Bank accounts
*	A `bank` holds different types of accounts for its customers: `deposit` accounts, `loan` accounts and `mortgage` accounts. Customers could be `individuals` or `companies`.
*	All accounts have customer, balance and interest rate (monthly based).
	*	Deposit accounts are allowed to deposit and with draw money.
	*	Loan and mortgage accounts can only deposit money.
*	All accounts can calculate their interest amount for a given period (in months). In the common case its is calculated as follows: `number_of_months` * `interest_rate`.
*	Loan accounts have no interest for the first `3` months if are held by individuals and for the first `2` months if are held by a company.
*	Deposit accounts have no interest if their balance is positive and less than `1000`.
*	Mortgage accounts have ½ interest for the first `12` months for companies and no interest for the first `6` months for individuals.
*	Your task is to write a program to model the bank system by classes and interfaces.
*	You should identify the classes, interfaces, base classes and abstract actions and implement the calculation of the interest functionality through overridden methods.

### Problem 3. Range Exceptions
*	Define a class `InvalidRangeException<T>` that holds information about an error condition related to invalid range. It should hold error message and a range definition [`start … end`].
*	Write a sample application that demonstrates the `InvalidRangeException<int>` and `InvalidRangeException<DateTime>` by entering numbers in the range [`1..100`] and dates in the range [`1.1.1980 … 31.12.2013`].
