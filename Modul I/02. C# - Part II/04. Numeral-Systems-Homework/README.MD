Homework: Numeral Systems
=========================

### Problem 1. Decimal to binary
*	Write a program to convert decimal numbers to their binary representation.

### Problem 2. Binary to decimal
*	Write a program to convert binary numbers to their decimal representation.

### Problem 3. Decimal to hexadecimal
*	Write a program to convert decimal numbers to their hexadecimal representation.

### Problem 4. Hexadecimal to decimal
*	Write a program to convert hexadecimal numbers to their decimal representation.

### Problem 5. Hexadecimal to binary
*	Write a program to convert hexadecimal numbers to binary numbers (directly).

### Problem 6. Binary to hexadecimal
*	Write a program to convert binary numbers to hexadecimal numbers (directly).

### Problem 7. One system to any other
*	Write a program to convert from any numeral system of given base `s` to any other numeral system of base `d` (2 &#8804; `s`, `d` &#8804; 16).

### Problem 8. Binary short
*	Write a program that shows the binary representation of given 16-bit signed integer number (the C# type `short`).

### Problem 9.* Binary floating-point
*	Write a program that shows the internal binary representation of given 32-bit signed floating-point number in IEEE 754 format (the C# type `float`).
