-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with popular development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.
Write in a text file called “list-of-IDEs.txt” at least five IDEs along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

		/* TOP 5 IDEs
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Im Focus: Visual Studio
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
		Visual Studio has an advantage when it comes to programming. This IDE is mostly used by corporate programmers to produce .NET code. Sometimes people want to try the product without investing thousands of dollars first, so Microsoft has the Express editions for all of their products. This makes it perfect for casual users that want to hack out some code as a hobby or programmers who need a free solution to code in C#. Be warned though, if the application developed by someone using the express versions of Visual Studio takes off and starts making money it would not be surprising to see big brother step in and start asking questions.
		
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Im Focus: Eclipse
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
		This is the best alternative if you are not a big fan of Microsoft’s Visual Studio. The interface is a lot cleaner and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that are possible to use extend past the .Net Framework. Besides being the number on way to develop Android applications via the Android SDK, it is fully extensible to use languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.
		
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Im Focus: Netbeans
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
		The is the number one alternative to Eclipse. This program is extensible and free, and it compiles code which is a bonus. When installing Netbeans it comes with a Java server called GlassFish that you could deploy on your computer for your testing environment. This server is the second biggest server for Java next to WebSphere (which is a whole different ball game).
		
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Im Focus: Komodo
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
		Komodo is a comprehensive IDE that supports all major programming languages, providing a single tool that meets your development needs across the spectrum. Whether you’re working with Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, HTML, CSS or JavaScript, Komodo provides a clean, intuitive interface with advanced editing capabilities and integrated tools for the most functionality.  
		
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Im Focus: IntelliJIdea
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
		IntelliJ IDEA 14 comes with a built-in decompiler for Java classes. When you want to take a look inside a library that you don't have the source code for, now you can – without any third-party plugins.
