## XML Processing in .NET
### _Homework_

1.  Create a XML file representing catalogue.
  * The catalogue should contain albums of different artists.
  * For each album you should define: `name`, `artist`, `year`, `producer`, `price` and a list of `songs`.
  * Each song should be described by title and duration.
1.  Write program that extracts all different artists which are found in the `catalog.xml`.
  * For each author you should print the number of albums in the catalogue.
  * Use the DOM parser and a hash-table.
1.  Implement the previous using XPath.
1.  Using the DOM parser write a program to delete from `catalog.xml` all albums having price > 20.
1.  Write a program, which using `XmlReader` extracts all song titles from `catalog.xml`.
1.  Rewrite the same using `XDocument` and LINQ query.
1.  In a text file we are given the name, address and phone number of given person (each at a single line).
  * Write a program, which creates new XML document, which contains these data in structured XML format.
1.  Write a program, which (using `XmlReader` and `XmlWriter`) reads the file `catalog.xml` and creates the file `album.xml`, in which stores in appropriate way the names of all albums and their authors.
1.  Write a program to traverse given directory and write to a XML file its contents together with all subdirectories and files.
  * Use tags `<file>` and `<dir>` with appropriate attributes.
  * For the generation of the XML document use the class `XmlWriter`.
1.  Rewrite the last exercises using `XDocument`, `XElement` and `XAttribute`.
1.  Write a program, which extract from the file `catalog.xml` the prices for all albums, published 5 years ago or earlier.
  * Use XPath query.
1.  Rewrite the previous using LINQ query.
1.  Create an XSL stylesheet, which transforms the file `catalog.xml` into HTML document, formatted for viewing in a standard Web-browser.
1.  Write a C# program to apply the XSLT stylesheet transformation on the file `catalog.xml` using the class `XslTransform`.
1.  *Read some tutorial about the `XQuery` language.
  * Implement the XML to HTML transformation with XQuery (instead of XSLT).
  * Download some open source XQuery library for .NET and execute the XQuery to transform the `catalog.xml` to HTML.
1.  Using Visual Studio generate an XSD schema for the file `catalog.xml`.
  * Write a C# program that takes an XML file and an XSD file (schema) and validates the XML file against the schema.
  * Test it with valid XML catalogs and invalid XML catalogs.
