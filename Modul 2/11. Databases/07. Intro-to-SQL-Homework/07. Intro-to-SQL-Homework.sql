the most important SQL commands.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard interactive and 
programming language for getting information from and updating a 
database. Although SQL is both an ANSI and an ISO standard, many 
database products support SQL with proprietary extensions to the 
standard language. Queries take the form of a command language that 
lets you select, insert, update, find out the location of data, and so
forth. There is also a programming interface.

Constructions used in the high-level procedural programming languages.
