# High-quality Classes Homework

## Task 1. Good Abstraction
*	Take the VS solution `Abstraction` and refactor its code to provide **good abstraction**.
	*	Move the properties and methods from the class `Figure` to their correct place.
	*	Move the common methods to the base class's interface.
	*	Remove all **duplicated code** (properties / methods / other code).

## Task 2. Good Encapsulation
*	Establish **good encapsulation** in the classes from the VS solution `Abstraction`.
	*	Ensure that incorrect values cannot be assigned in the internal state of the classes.

## Task 3. Cohesion and Coupling
*	Take the VS solution `Cohesion-and-Coupling` and refactor its code to follow the principles of **good abstraction**, **loose coupling** and **strong cohesion**.
	*	Split the class `Utils` to other classes that have strong cohesion and are loosely coupled internally.

## Task 4. Inheritance and Polymorphism
*	Redesign the classes and refactor the code from the solution `Inheritance-and-Polymorphism` to follow the best practices in high-quality classes.
	*	Extract abstract base class and move all common properties in it.
	*	Encapsulate the fields and make sure required fields are not left without a value.
	*	Reuse the repeating code though base methods.
