# JavaScript OOP 2015 - Audio Player
*	Create an object (module) that enables creation of the following:
		
##	`Player`
that has the following:

*	properties:	
	*	`name` - provided through a constructor function or init method
*	methods:
	*	`getPlayer('name')`
		*	returns a new `Player` with the provided `name`
	*	`addPlaylist(playlistToAdd)`
		*	Adds a playlist to the player
		*	`playlistToAdd` must be a `PlayList` instance
			*	Otherwise, throw an error
		*	Enables chaining
	*	`getPlaylistById(id)`
		*	Finds and returns a playlist from the playlists in this player instance
		*	Returns null, if a playlist with the provided id is not contained in the player 
	*	`removePlaylist(id)`
		*	Removes a playlists from this player instance, and the playlist must have an `id` equal to the provided `id`
		*	Enables chaining
		*	Throws an error, if a playlist with the provided `id` is not contained in the player 
	*	`removePlaylist(playlist)`
		*	Removes a playlists from this player instance, and the playlist must have an `id` equal to the `id` of the provided playlist
		*	Enables chaining
		*	Throws an error, if a playlist with the provided id is not contained in the player 
	*	`listPlaylists(page, size)`
		*	Returns an array with at most size `size` and containing the playlists with indices page*size, page*size+1, page*size+2, ... page*(size+1)-1
			*	These are the indices after sorting the playlist by name, then by id
		*	If there are less that `size` playlists, return all of them
		*	Throw an error if:
			*	page*size > COUNT_OF_PLAYLISTS_IN_PLAYER
			*	page < 0
			*	size <= 0
		*	__Example__:

				//having 35 playlists:			
				//listPlaylists(2, 10) should return playlists with indices from 20 to 29, including			 
				//listPlaylists(3, 10) should return playlists with indices from 30 to 34, including

##	`PlayList`
that has the following:

*	properties:
	*	`id` - generated when the playlist is created
	*	`name` - provided through a constructor function or init method
*	methods:
	*	`addPlayable(playable)`
		*	Adds a playable to the `PlayList`
		*	The same playable can be added multiple times		
		*	Enables chaining
	*	`getPlayableById(id)`
		*	Returns the playable that has the provided `id`
		*	Returns null, if no playable is found with the provided `id`
	*	`removePlayable(id)`
		*	Removes a playable from this playlist, and the playable must have an `id` equal to the provided `id`
		*	Enables chaining
		*	Throws an error, if a playable with the provided `id` is not contained in the playlist 
	*	`removePlayable(playable)`
		*	Removes a playable from this playlist, and the playable must have an `id` equal to the `id` of the provided playable
		*	Enables chaining
		*	Throws an error, if a playable with the provided id is not contained in the playlist
	*	`listPlaylables(page, size)`
		*	Returns an array with at most size `size` and containing the playables with indices `page*size, page*size+1, page*size+2, ... page*(size+1)-1`
			*	These are the indices after sorting the playables by `title`, then by `id`
		*	If there are less that `size` playables, return all of them
		*	Throw an error if:
			*	`page*size > COUNT_OF_PLAYABLE_IN_PLAYLIST`
			*	`page < 0`
			*	`size <= 0`
		*	__Example__:

				//having 35 playables:
				//rockPlaylist.listPlayables(2, 10) should return playables with indices from 20 to 29, including
				//rockPlaylist.listPlayables(3, 10) should return playables with indices from 30 to 34, including
			
##	`Playable`
that has the following :
*	properties:
	*	`id` - generated when the playable is created
	*	`title` - provided through a constructor function or init method
	*	`author` - provided through a constructor function or init method
*	methods:
	*	`play()`
		*	returns a string in the format: `[id]. [title] - [author]`
	
##	`Audio`
that inherits `Playable` and adds the following:

*	properties:
	*	`length`
		*	provided through a constructor function or init method
		*	number, greater than **0**
*	methods:
	*	`play()`
		*	reuses the `play()` from `Playable` and adds: ` - [length]` at the end

##	`Video`
that inherits `Playable` and adds the following:

*	properties:
	*	`imdbRating`
		*	provided through a constructor function or init method
		*	number, between **1** and **5**
*	methods:
	*	`play()`
		*	reuses the `play()` from `Playable` and adds: ` - [imdbRating]` at the end
				
##	General requirements:
*	All `id` are numbers, greater than **0**
*	Each player instance has an unique `id`
*	Each playlist instance has an unique `id`
*	Each playable instance has an unique `id`
*	Properties `name`, `title` and `author` are a strings between **3** and **25** characters
	
*	You can use any Inheritance in JavaScript you like
	*	For example: Prototypal or Classical

## The module should look as follows:

	var module = {
		getPlayer: function (name){
			// returns a new player instance with the provided name
		},
		getPlaylist: function(name){
			//returns a new playlist instance with the provided name
		},
		getAudio: function(title, author, length){
			//returns a new audio instance with the provided title, author and length
		},
		getVideo: function(title, author, imdbRating){
			//returns a new video instance with the provided title, author and imdbRating
		}
	};
