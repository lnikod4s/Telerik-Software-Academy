					Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more
					than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before
					it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to
					reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable
					than the language as a wholeâ€”a subset you can use to create truly extensible and
					efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the
					development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good
					ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming
					language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an
					expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in
					with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global
					variables.
