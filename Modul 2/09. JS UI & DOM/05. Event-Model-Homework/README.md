##Task 1
Create a function that takes an id or DOM element and:
* If an id is provided, select the element
* Finds all elements with class `button` or `content` within the provided element
  * Change the content of all `.button` elements with "hide"
* When a `.button` is clicked:
  * Find the topmost `.content` element, that is before another `.button` and:
    * If the `.content` is visible:
      * Hide the `.content`
      * Change the content of the `.button` to "show"       
    * If the `.content` is hidden:
      * Show the `.content`
      * Change the content of the `.button` to "hide"
    * If there isn't a `.content` element **after the clicked `.button`** and **before other `.button`**, do nothing
* Throws if:
  * The provided DOM element is non-existent
  * The id is either not a string or does not select any DOM element
